Super Mario Bros Level 1
=============
DESCRIPTION:
This is an attempt to use a recreation of the first level of Super Mario Bros. to create an evoltuionary/genetic machine learning alorgithm to make mario finish the level without human input. 

This is using reinforced learning; so as mario moves more towards the right/the castle, he will gain more points.
